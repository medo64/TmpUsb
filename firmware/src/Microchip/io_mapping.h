//This section is the set of definitions required by the MCHPFSUSB

//  running in, and where it can find the results to some information
//  that the stack needs.
//These definitions are required by every application developed with
//  this revision of the MCHPFSUSB framework.  Please review each
//  option carefully and determine which options are desired/required
//  for your application.
