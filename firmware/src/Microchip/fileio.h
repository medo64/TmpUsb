    Parameters:
        FILEIO_TIMESTAMP * - Pointer to a timestamp structure that 
            must be populated by the user's function.

  Function:

  Summary:
    Allows user to get the drive properties (size of drive, free space, etc)

   Conditions:
    1) ALLOW_GET_FILEIO_DRIVE_PROPERTIES must be defined in FSconfig.h
    2) a FS_FILEIO_DRIVE_PROPERTIES object must be created before the function is called
    3) the new_request member of the FS_FILEIO_DRIVE_PROPERTIES object must be set before
        calling the function for the first time.  This will start a new search.
    4) this function should not be called while there is a file open.  Close all
        files before calling this function.

  Input:
    properties - a pointer to a FS_FILEIO_DRIVE_PROPERTIES object where the results should
      be stored.

  Return Values:
    This function returns void.  The properties_status of the previous call of 
      this function is located in the properties.status field.  This field has 
      the following possible values:

    FILEIO_GET_PROPERTIES_NO_ERRORS - operation completed without error.  Results
      are in the properties object passed into the function.
    FILEIO_GET_PROPERTIES_DRIVE_NOT_MOUNTED - there is no mounted disk.  Results in
      properties object is not valid
    FILEIO_GET_PROPERTIES_CLUSTER_FAILURE - there was a failure trying to read a 
      cluster from the drive.  The results in the properties object is a partial
      result up until the point of the failure.
    FILEIO_GET_PROPERTIES_STILL_WORKING - the search for free sectors is still in
      process.  Continue calling this function with the same properties pointer 
      until either the function completes or until the partial results meets the
      application needs.  The properties object contains the partial results of
      the search and can be used by the application.  

  Side Effects:
    Can cause errors if called when files are open.  Close all files before
    calling this function.

    Calling this function without setting the new_request member on the first
    call can result in undefined behavior and results.

    Calling this function after a result is returned other than
    FILEIO_GET_PROPERTIES_STILL_WORKING can result in undefined behavior and results.

  Description:  
    This function returns the information about the mounted drive.  The results 
    member of the properties object passed into the function is populated with 
    the information about the drive.    

    Before starting a new request, the new_request member of the properties
    input parameter should be set to true.  This will initiate a new search
    request.

    This function will return before the search is complete with partial results.
    All of the results except the free_clusters will be correct after the first
    call.  The free_clusters will contain the number of free clusters found up
    until that point, thus the free_clusters result will continue to grow until
    the entire drive is searched.  If an application only needs to know that a 
    certain number of bytes is available and doesn't need to know the total free 
    size, then this function can be called until the required free size is
    verified.  To continue a search, pass a pointer to the same FILEIO_FILEIO_DRIVE_PROPERTIES
    object that was passed in to create the search.

    A new search request should be made once this function has returned a value 
    other than FILEIO_GET_PROPERTIES_STILL_WORKING.  Continuing a completed search
    can result in undefined behavior or results.

    Typical Usage:
    <code>
    FILEIO_DRIVE_PROPERTIES disk_properties;

    disk_properties.new_request = true;

    do
    {
        FILEIO_DiskPropertiesGet(&disk_properties, 'A');
    } while (disk_properties.properties_status == FILEIO_GET_PROPERTIES_STILL_WORKING);
    </code>

    results.disk_format - contains the format of the drive.  Valid results are 
      FAT12(1), FAT16(2), or FAT32(3).

    results.sector_size - the sector size of the mounted drive.  Valid values are
      512, 1024, 2048, and 4096.

    results.sectors_per_cluster - the number sectors per cluster.

    results.total_clusters - the number of total clusters on the drive.  This 
      can be used to calculate the total disk size (total_clusters * 
      sectors_per_cluster * sector_size = total size of drive in bytes)

    results.free_clusters - the number of free (unallocated) clusters on the drive.
      This can be used to calculate the total free disk size (free_clusters * 
      sectors_per_cluster * sector_size = total size of drive in bytes)

  Remarks:
    PIC24F size estimates:
      Flash - 400 bytes (-Os setting)

    PIC24F speed estimates:
      Search takes approximately 7 seconds per Gigabyte of drive space.  Speed
        will vary based on the number of sectors per cluster and the sector size.
